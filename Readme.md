A powerful desktop application for managing and organizing astronomical image files. PhotonFinder (also known as AstroFileManager) helps astronomers and astrophotographers efficiently search, filter, and manage their astronomical data collections.

## üåü Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Tabbed Interface** - Multitasking support with multiple search tabs for efficient workflow
- **Offline Operations** - Most functions work offline; searches can be performed without original files available (perfect for external media)
- **Advanced Search & Filtering** - Narrow down searches using multiple criteria including:
  - Cone search around given coordinates
  - Exposure time, date ranges, telescope, binning, gain, temperature
  - FITS header text search
  - Custom metadata filters

### File Format Support
- **Compressed FITS Files** - Full support for gzip, bzip2, and xz compressed FITS files for space saving
- **XISF Files** - Supports XISF files with FITS keywords (as produced by PixInsight, N.I.N.A.)

### Advanced Tools
- **Batch Plate Solving** - Automated plate solving using ASTAP and Astrometry.net
- **Calibration Frame Matching** - Find matching calibration files (darks, flats) for your light frames
- **Data Export** - Export LIGHT files with calibration data for easy import into stacking programs
- **File Management** - Find files used in processing and identify unprocessed data
- **Telescopius Integration** - Check Telescopius lists for objects that have already been imaged

### Database & Library Management
- **SQLite Database** - Efficient metadata storage and retrieval
- **Library Roots** - Define and manage multiple library directories
- **Automated Scanning** - Keep your database updated with file changes
- **Backup & Restore** - Database backup and restoration capabilities

### Reporting & Analysis
- **Comprehensive Reports** - Generate metadata reports, file lists, and data usage statistics
- **Target Lists** - Create Telescopius-compatible target lists
- **Usage Analytics** - Track your imaging data and storage usage

## üñ•Ô∏è Platform Support

- **Windows** - Full support (current)
- **Linux** - Support coming soon

## üìã Requirements
